# Hi, I’m John — IT Director & AI architect building transparent, auditable AI systems

I build practical AI products and infrastructure:
- **Weaver-CCI** – Authorship “nutrition labels” for content (human vs AI provenance).
- **Murrow** – An all-AI newsroom MVP (CLI + API) with provenance and tests.
- **The-Cover** – Sports odds/projections API + reference UI.
- **Narrative-AI-Systems** – Runnable notebooks exploring RAG and agent workflows.

### Highlights
- 🏷️ **Weaver-CCI** → provenance labels as SVG + a JS web component.  
- 📰 **Murrow** → Dockerized service with CLI + API, minimal CI.  
- 🧮 **The-Cover** → FastAPI mock with roadmap + OpenAPI.  
- 🔬 **Narrative-AI-Systems** → notebooks showing “how” (not just “what”).

**Now exploring:** transparent model evaluation, simple agent tools, and governance patterns for AI.
